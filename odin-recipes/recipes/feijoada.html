        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2cups chopped onion, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 cup green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package dry black beans, soaked overnight</li>
            <li>2 smoked ham hocks</li>
            <li>8 ounces diced ham</li>
            <li>1/2 pound thickly sliced bacon, diced</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves, crushed</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add 3/4 cup chopped onion, green onions, and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 4 minutes. Pour in soaked beans and fill with enough water to cover beans by 3 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered for 2 hours, or until tender.</li>
            <li>While beans are cooking, place ham hocks in a smaller pot with 1/4 cup chopped onion. Cover with water and simmer until meat pulls off of the bone easily, about 1 hour. Drain and add to beans.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place ham, bacon, and remaining onion in a baking dish. Bake until mixture is crispy, 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain bacon and ham mixture and add to beans. Season with bay leaves, coriander, salt, and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes more.            </li>
            <li>Stir in chopped cilantro and parsley just before serving.</li>
        </ol>
